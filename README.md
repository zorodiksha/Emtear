EMTEAR system emergency traffic clear
EMTEAR is a system where vehicle in emergency don't have to wait in traffic

ESP32, leds, resistors, ESP32 cam are used for the prototype 

To accomplish a successful emergency trafic clear this edge computing system
is developed where initially traffic light code is supposed to be startted such that
trafic switching at an intersection and web server are on.
Camera is turned on through camera code where the images are posted at a url.
Emtear code is turned on such that the python file will scan above mentioned QR and 
compare it with capure url image and if it matches a trigger code is activated using
the destination of web server 
and green light is there for lane 1
Scanning the QR code can let users know there current location
